                    I mean what really makes a person who they are? I think itâ€™s the company they keep; the people they collaborate
                    with socially and professionally. The thing is you want to work with people who are adaptable, who can fit a mold
                    and drive you creatively and motivate you. Hear what I have to offer and I assure you that I would be that fit
                    for your purposes.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is Mohid Tanveer, I am a current junior at Rhodes
                    College studying Computer Science. I am currently interested in Data Structures/Systems and Cloud Computing Systems.
                    I am proficient in Python, C, Java, C, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and I am fluent in React.js, Racket, and C++.<br /><br />
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I am the kind of person who loves to learn new skills and refine them.
                    &nbsp;Nothing is perfect, everything is an unfinished project; you can always improve. You will find evidence of
                    this idea on this website.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; I pride myself as an organized person, I like to keep everything
                    in scope and work on things in parts; considering all the possibilities.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
