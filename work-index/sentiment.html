                <i>Created in Java — OCTOBER 2022 —</i>

                This project created during my Data Structures and Algorithms course. I first implemented the data structure that would be utilized by the program
                which was a map implemented with a binary search tree. The program itself is a sentiment analysis program that takes in a text file and 
                calculates the average sentiment of reviews, allowing for the user to input their own sentences and calculate the sentiment of their statement. 
                The BST map stores a collection of words with their frequencies and total scores from reviews in order to calculate the sentiment of user input.
                The scores range from 0 to 4 with 0 being the worst and 4 being a perfect score. <a href="../files/sentimentanalysis.MD" target="_blank">Here</a> 
                is an example of the program in action. You can obviously see that the algorithm implemented in the program is not perfect, especially when dealing
                with cases of sarcasm. However, it is a good example of how a simple algorithm can be used to calculate the sentiment of a statement. The main objectives
                of this project were to implement a BST map and to practice scanning through files and isolating necessary information.
