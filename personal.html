            <span style="color: #ffed00;">Data and its Manipulation</span><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>How can you define life's instances?</i> — How can you formulate extrapolations for these instances? 
            — consideration of the most basic forms and analysis of everything. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I am interested in the design and application of data structures
            within software engineering. This idea that you can collect and group data together in order to solve different issues or provide different services is what drives me within
            the field of computer science and I am interested in learning more about it.

            <span style="color: #ffed00;">Design and Implementation</span><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Minimalistic, yet Complex?</i> — A Living Contradiction; Splitting myself into pages. — these ideas are the inspiration for this site. 
            — a wreckage of variables, beauty in simplified layers.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  When creating I like to be deliberate about what I do, I want everything to 
            have its meaning and purpose (sometimes even multiple). I want to be able to create something that stimulate minds; grabs and guides your attention and getting the user 
            to interact and learn more.<br><br><br><br><div style="text-align: center"><h2>Cohesion is bliss, enjoy yourself.</h2></div> <br><br><br>

            <span style="color: #ffed00;">Music and the Visual Arts</span><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Create and Consume</i> — A cathartic release of emotion. As humans we are led to consume that which targets our senses and emotions.
            Since these forms of media are the most accessible, they are also the most powerful. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Growing up I was always fascinated by the idea
            of creating something. I wanted to be able to look at something I made and feel that feeling of satisfaction. I taught myself how to produce music, mix and master, and 
            play guitar my freshman year of high school and have been learning ever since. I believe that these skills and mindsets enable me to be a better developer/designer as 
            I have an intrinsic motivation to learn how to create and apply my skills more cohesively and effectively in the realms of software engineering and development.<br><br><br><br>

            <span style="color: #ffed00;">Personality and Drive</span><br>
            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Driven, Easy-Going, Eager to Do Things</i> — Its always hard to tell a person's true personality through only words on a screen. 
            Visuals tend to speak louder to me.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; People who meet me, know that I am easy to get to know; I find it easy to relate to and understand people and
            speak about different topics and interests. Being passionate about a variety of things allows me to gague the interests of others and find common ground; grouping together 
            multiple differing personalities and interests together to create a cohesive environment. I am able to view things from different perspectives and understand how to reach 
            different audiences from a development standpoint. I think maintaining good social interactions with the people around me truly allows me to learn so much more from them and
            further myself as a person and in my career. Feel free to reach out, get to know me, and see how I could slot in with your team and vision.
