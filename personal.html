            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Minimalistic, yet Complex? A Living Contradiction; Splitting myself into pages.</i> — these ideas are the inspiration for this site. 
            — a wreckage of variables, beauty in simplified layers.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  When creating I like to be deliberate about what I do, I want everything to 
            have its meaning and purpose (sometimes even multiple). I want to be able to create something that stimulate minds; grabs and guides your attention and getting the user 
            to interact and learn more.<br><br><br><br><div style="text-align: center"><h2>Art is everywhere, so make something beautiful.</h2></div> <br><br><br><br><br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <i>Create and Consume</i> — A cathartic release of emotion. As humans we are led to consume that which targets our senses and emotions.
            Since these forms of media are the most accessible, they are also the most powerful. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Growing up I was always fascinated by the idea
            of creating something. I wanted to be able to look at something I made and feel that feeling of satisfaction. I taught myself how to produce music, mix and master, and 
            play guitar my freshman year of high school and have been learning ever since. I believe that these skills and mindsets enable me to be a better developer/designer as 
            I have an intrinsic motivation to learn how to create and apply my skills more cohesively and effectively in the realms of software engineering and development.

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Unknown</b> — <i>Color, Cut and Blow</i> — Never has someone made such a scene from my chair. “You’ve ruined my 
            life!!” Etc. Etc. I have such raging <i>l’esprit de l'escalier</i>! Of course on a day with new clients all around. But returned her venom with 
            firm grace and apology. Thought it wise not to unleash; “I can’t afford a whole new set of enemies.” She didn’t pay; I should have had her arrested.

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Hannah J</b>. — <i>Cut and Blow</i> — it is remarkable how much this woman looks like Marisa Berenson in 
            <i>Death in Venice</i>. Too beautiful really, distractingly so. Especially looking at this autumn leaf of a face. I think she’s a lawyer too. 
            Oh and she’s nice. A nice, gorgeous shark in the water. <br><br>Tip = $100<br><br><br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Tracy M</b>. — <i>Color, Cut and Blow</i> — The new salon is brilliant. Aqueous filtered light everywhere — 
            otherworldly. Nicholas is a master. I am broke but worth it. He even remembered the quince blossoms. Long, noble Quince flanking every station. 
            I’m in ecstasy. <br><br>Tip = $150.00<br><br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Ella H</b>. — <i>Cut and Blow</i> — So hungover. Hands shaking. A sweating queasy mess. And my face — I know It’s 
            not advisable for a man to wear so much concealer, but what can be done? My eyes look like tires with a bit of red in the middle. Worried that the 
            mask will collapse into a client’s lap. A lovely night with Julian though. No one is so attractive and so present. His lower back is a topography 
            of dreams. Talked of going away. <br><br>Tip = $75.00<br><br><br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Hannah J</b>. — <i>Cut and Blow</i> — Berenson back. Transcendental refinement — paroxysms of admiration for that 
            face. Can’t see any stitch marks and I think she’s getting younger (not me). I would almost cut her hair for free. <br><br>Tip = $150.00<br><br><br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Dr. Susan</b> — <i>Color, Cut and Blow</i> — It’s kind of fun to cut your plastic surgeon’s hair, we exchanged 
            a glance in the mirror akin to the bow during a minuet (now it’s my turn). But a bit unbalanced (she drives a Rolls after all). I’m the upstart 
            stable boy and she the slumming aristocracy. I know it’s not healthy to think such classist things. As my I-Ching once said, “It is not of noble 
            aspect to look upwards with mouth drooling.” Fair enough. Cigarette?<br><br>Tip = $125.00<br><br><br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Sandy L</b>. — <i>Blow</i> — I have known Sandy for soooo long. We had a bump by the wash stations. 
            Being keyed up whilst cutting is pretty great. She gave me a number — I need to keep some around for the days of intestinal endlessness. 
            Everyday ha.<br><br>Tip = $150.00<br><br><br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Carey K</b>. — <i>Color, Cut and Blow</i> — Started smoking again. It’s so bad. I have to practically 
            scrub down to bone to remove the odor. But it never really goes away (very lady Macbeth). No one has complained though. But still. I 
            just love the breaks. Stare into a hedge. Watch a bit wrapper blow by. Look at cloud. Something prevents us from doing this without an 
            occupation. A cigarette makes fertile absent-mindedness possible. Whatever — so healthy and so unhealthy. <br><br>Tip = $75.00<br>br><br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Kate U</b>. — <i>Cut and Blow</i> — The thing about cutting a celebrity’s hair is this: it’s horrible. 
            You have to be the oldest of friends and the most reserved of surgeons. Mostly though you have to act as if you really care (who’s the 
            actress now?). It’s abhorrent but keeps the wolves from the door. <br><br>Tip = $00.00<br><br><br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Alex P</b>. — <i>Cut and Blow</i> — Is it wrong to ask a client out? It’s definitely in poor form 
            but “wrong”? I mean we are so well-suited and how many paths does one really cross? But what of beautiful Julian? <br><br>
            Tip = $175<br><br><br><br>

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Jenny H</b>. — <i>Color, Cut and Blow</i> — Back from vacation with Julian. He wants to marry. 
            Why do people always need more? Rhetorical. It’s just that I’m in such a good place. Construction is done; Doheny is perfection. 
            I do love him, but it’s difficult being a narcissist. <br><br>Tip = $100<br><br><br>
